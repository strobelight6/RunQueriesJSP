=========Part 3===========
First run our latest and greatest ProjectDDL.sql and ProjectInsert.sql.

Included is a file entitled clean_up_neo4j.cipher that cleans up the graph
	database similarly to our ProjectInsert.sql.

PDFs are included in directory PDF Files

SQL files are included in directory SQL files.

CIPHER files are included in directory CIPHER files.

=========Part 4===========
WebContent will have to be added into a project set up similarly to our
	in class activity ExampleJSP (which contains Apache Tomcat v.9.0 and 
	my-sql-connector-java-5.1.48). An example ExampleJSP project will
	be included with proper WebContent files, however you may have to
	properly configure your Apache Tomcat v9.0 if any errors arise.

In order to start our application, run login.jsp on your server. This is
	found within the WebContent folder of the project.

Error page has back button at bottom if input values are put in wrongly.
